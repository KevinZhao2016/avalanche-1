This repo is the beginnings of a Go implementation of https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUy4jh5mGNZvLkjies1RWM4YuvJh5o2FYopNPVYwrRVGV . At the moment it is a toy implementation designed to encode the ideas of the paper.

The goal is to have a production-ready consensus algorithm library implementing various pieces of the paper.
